# Word Frequency Analyzer  

## Overview  
Word Frequency Analyzer is a web application that accepts a URL, fetches the content of the webpage, and analyzes the top 10 most frequent words on that page. The frontend is built using React, and the backend uses Node.js with Express. The application uses `axios` for HTTP requests and `cheerio` for HTML parsing.  

## Features  
- Accepts a URL as input.  
- Extracts and processes webpage content to calculate word frequencies.  
- Displays the top 10 most frequent words and their counts in a sortable, interactive table.  
- Real-time communication between frontend and backend using REST API.
